<!-- 
	Sample icons file. This file looks like an SVG file with groups as its
	children. Each group element has an ID that must match the ID of the button given
	in the extension. The SVG inside the group makes up the actual icon, and
	needs use a viewBox instead of width/height for it to scale	properly.
	
	Multiple icons can be included, each within their own group.
